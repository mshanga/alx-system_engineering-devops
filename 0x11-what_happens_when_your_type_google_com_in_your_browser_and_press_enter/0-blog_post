Here's a breakdown of what happens when you type "google.com" into your browser and press enter.

Step 1: DNS Lookup
When you type "google.com" into your browser, the first thing that happens is a DNS lookup. This is the process of converting the human-readable domain name "google.com" into an IP address that the computer can understand. The browser sends a request to the DNS resolver to look up the IP address associated with the domain name "google.com". The DNS resolver then responds with the IP address of the Google server.

Step 2: HTTP Request
Once the browser has the IP address, it opens a connection to the server using the HTTP protocol. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server requesting the homepage of Google.

Step 3: Server Response
When the server receives the HTTP request, it processes the request and generates an HTTP response. The response contains the HTML code for the Google homepage along with any other assets such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.

Step 4: Rendering
The browser receives the HTTP response from the server and starts rendering the webpage. The browser parses the HTML code, processes the CSS and JavaScript files, and renders the final webpage on your screen.

Step 5: Display
Once the rendering is complete, the final Google homepage is displayed on your screen.

It's important to note that the steps above are a simplified version of what actually happens when you type "google.com" into your browser. In reality, there are many more steps involved in the process, such as SSL/TLS handshake, caching, and content delivery networks (CDNs). However, this overview should give you a basic understanding of what happens behind the scenes when you type "google.com" into your browser.
