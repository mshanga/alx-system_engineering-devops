## Issue Summary

Duration: The outage occurred on May 12th, 2023, at approximately 10:15 AM EST and lasted for two hours until it was resolved at 12:15 PM EST.

Impact: The outage impacted our customers' ability to access their accounts, complete transactions, and use our digital banking services. Approximately 80% of our users were affected by the outage, and they were unable to perform any transactions during the two-hour period.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a configuration change that was introduced during a software update the previous evening, which caused a critical service in our banking system to fail when it was restarted.

## Timeline

- 10:15 AM EST: The issue was detected when our monitoring systems alerted our technical teams of a service failure.
- 10:20 AM EST: Our technical teams began investigating the issue and determined that the service failure was due to a configuration change that was introduced during a software update.
- 10:30 AM EST: The team attempted to roll back the configuration change but found that the change was not reversible.
- 10:45 AM EST: The team began investigating other potential root causes and conducted a series of tests to identify the issue.
- 11:15 AM EST: The team escalated the issue to the development team to assist in identifying and resolving the root cause.
- 12:15 PM EST: The issue was resolved, and normal operations were restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the outage was a configuration change that was introduced during a software update, which caused a critical service in our banking system to fail when it was restarted. The team identified the issue by conducting a series of tests and working with the development team to analyze the code.

To resolve the issue, the team rolled back the software update and restored the service to its previous configuration. They then conducted a series of tests to ensure that the service was functioning correctly and that the issue had been fully resolved.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we have implemented the following corrective and preventative measures:

- We have improved our change management process to prevent configuration changes from causing outages in the future. Changes will now be more rigorously tested and validated before they are introduced into our production environment.
- We have increased our monitoring and alerting capabilities to provide early warning of potential issues and allow for quicker response times.
- We have enhanced our communication channels with customers to ensure that they are notified of issues in a timely and transparent manner.
- We have conducted additional training for our technical teams to improve their ability to identify and respond to incidents quickly and effectively.

## Tasks to Address the Issue

To address the issue, we have identified the following specific tasks:

- Perform a full review of our software deployment processes to identify potential areas for improvement.
- Develop and implement a testing framework to ensure that all configuration changes are thoroughly tested before they are introduced into our production environment.
- Implement additional monitoring and alerting capabilities to provide early warning of potential issues and allow for quicker response times.
- Conduct regular training for our technical teams to ensure that they are up-to-date with the latest incident response procedures and best practices.

In conclusion, the banking system outage that occurred on May 12th, 2023, was a significant event that impacted our customers and our operations. However, we were able to quickly identify the root cause of the issue, restore normal operations, and take steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. We remain committed to providing our customers with reliable and secure banking services and will continue to invest in the systems and processes necessary to achieve that goal.
